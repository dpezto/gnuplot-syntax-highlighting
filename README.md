# Gnuplot syntax highlighting for Vim
I built this package from the ground up as a follow up of the work made by [James Eberle](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1737) and [Andrew Rasmussen](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4873).

## Notice
The aim of this package is to provide up-to-date support for gnuplot syntax. I'm basing the support for gnuplot 5.5 which is currently in development.

## Status
This began as a personal project since I like better the results of the plots done with gnuplot so most of the syntax currently in the file is for my use case. Despite this, the package can handle almost all use cases of gnuplot. I'm looking forward to refine the syntax highlighting. PRs are welcome!
